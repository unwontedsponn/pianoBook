# pianoBook

This is the prototype of my digital piano education book Beginner To Composer In 14 Days.
This was my first project were I consolidated my self-guided knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Almost every diagram is a coded SVG image, 
the simple diagrams were coded in HTML, but the more complicated diagrams (such as the pianos) were coded using Javascript.
